# Goldbach-Speculation
According to Goldbach's speculation, each even natural number can be written as a sum of 2 odd numbers (p.e. 12 = 7 + 5,  46 = 3 + 43). This programme finds all the odd numbers combinations which if they are combined together, they create the even numbers from 2 to 1000 inclusively.
